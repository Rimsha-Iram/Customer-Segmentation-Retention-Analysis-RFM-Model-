## ðŸ§© 01_Data_ingest_and_cleaning.ipynb
**Goal:** Prepare and clean the Online Retail dataset for RFM modeling.

**Main Steps:**
- Loaded and inspected data (`online_retail.csv`)
- Cleaned missing `CustomerID` entries
- Removed negative/cancelled transactions
- Created `TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice`
- Converted date and numeric fields
- Saved cleaned dataset â†’ `data/interim/online_retail_interim.csv`

## ðŸ§© 02_RFM_Feature_Engineering.ipynb
**Goal:** Generate customer-level RFM metrics and scores.

**Key Steps:**
- Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary per customer.
- Used quantile-based scoring (1â€“5 scale).
- Created `RFM_score = R + F + M`.
- Exported `customer_rfm.csv`.
